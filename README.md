## 🔍 Key Objectives  
- Analyze vendor performance across sales, purchases, and profit margins.  
- Identify top-performing and low-performing vendors.  
- Validate profit margin differences statistically.  
- Optimize pricing and inventory management strategies.  
- Provide data-driven recommendations to management.

## 🔑 Key Insights  
- Top 10 vendors contribute **65.7% of purchases**, creating dependency risks.  
- Bulk purchasing achieves **72% lower unit costs**, driving cost efficiency.  
- Low-performing vendors maintain **higher margins but low sales volumes**, hinting at pricing inefficiencies.  
- Unsold inventory ties up **$2.71M**, reducing liquidity.  

---

## ✅ Recommendations  
- Adjust pricing for low-sales, high-margin vendors to boost volumes.  
- Diversify vendor partnerships to reduce supply chain risks.  
- Leverage **bulk purchasing strategies** for competitive pricing.  
- Optimize slow-moving inventory through clearance, adjusted procurement, or bundling.  
- Enhance marketing and distribution efforts for underperforming vendors.
